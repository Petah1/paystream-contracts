//! Fuzz target for `withdraw` arithmetic (SEC-09).
//!
//! The `withdraw` function performs several arithmetic operations on
//! `withdrawn`, `deposit`, and the value returned by `claimable_amount`:
//!
//!   1. `claimable_amount(stream, now)` → `amount`  (see `fuzz_claimable.rs`)
//!   2. `stream.withdrawn.checked_add(amount)` → new `withdrawn`
//!   3. `stream.withdrawn >= stream.deposit`   → Exhausted transition
//!
//! This target drives those operations directly with extreme values (large
//! deposits, very high rates, long elapsed times) and verifies that:
//!
//! * No panic occurs for well-formed input (except the documented E004
//!   overflow when `rate * elapsed` overflows i128).
//! * The amount returned is non-negative and ≤ remaining deposit.
//! * After a simulated withdraw the new `withdrawn` value never exceeds
//!   `deposit`.
//! * The Exhausted transition triggers if and only if `withdrawn >= deposit`.
